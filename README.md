League of Legends Netlog Viewer
===============================

A simple and easy-to-use tool to view and analyze the contents of a netlog file (located in `C:\...\League of Legends\Logs\Network Logs`). Creates pretty graphs and analyzes contents to quickly find network events, such as disconnects, high ping, and high packet loss.

Requires Java 7 or higher. Uses the amazingly pretty [Web Look and Feel](http://weblookandfeel.com/).
